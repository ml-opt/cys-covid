 * @brief The rastrigin class represents an optimization solutions which 
 * fitness cost is calculated via Rastrigin function.
 *
 * The equation for this function is given by:
 *
 * f(x) = 10n + \sum_{i=0}^n{x_i^2-10\cos(2\pi x_i)}
 *
 * Rastrigin function have a global minima in {0,..., 0} with a value of 0. 
 * A commonly used search domain for testing is [-5.12, 5.12]. Rastrigin is
 * continuous, differentiable, separable, scalable and multimodal. See the 
 * following reference:
