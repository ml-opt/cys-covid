 * @brief The eggh class represents an optimization solutions which
 * fitness cost is calculated via Egg Holder function.
 *
 * The equation for this function is given by:
 *
 * f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}[-({x_{i+1}}+47)\sin\sqrt{|{{x_{i+1}+{x_i}/2+47}|}}-
 * {x_i}\sin\sqrt{|{x_i}-({x_{i+1}}+47)|}]
 *
 * Egg Holder function have a global minima in {512, 404.2319} with a near value 
 * of 959.64.
 * A commonly used search domain for testing is [-512, 512]. Egg Holder 
 * is continuous, differentiable, non-separable, scalable and multimodal.
