 * @brief The schwefel class represents an optimization solution which 
 * fitness cost is calculated via Schwefel function.
 *
 * The equation for this function is given by:
 *
 * f(x) = -1/n\sum_{i=0}^n{x_i\sin{\sqrt{|x_i|}}}
 *
 * Schwefel function have a global minima in Â±[\pi(0.5 + k)]^2 with a value of 
 * -418.983.  A commonly used search domain for testing is [-500, 5000]. Schwefel 
 * is continuous, differentiable, separable, scalable and multimodal. See the 
 * following reference[f_128] in:
