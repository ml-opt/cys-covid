 * @brief The csendes class represents an optimization solutions which
 * fitness cost is calculated via Csendes function.
 *
 * The equation for this function is given by:
 *
 * f(x) = -0.1 * {\sum_{i=0}^{n}{{x_i}^{6}*(2+sin(1/{x_i}))}
 *
 * Csendes function have a global minima in {0,..., 0} with a value of 0.
 * A commonly used search domain for testing is [-1, 1]. Csendes 
 * is continuous, differentiable, separable, scalable and multimodal.
