 * @brief The cosine_m class represents an optimization solutions which
 * fitness cost is calculated via Cosine Mixture function.
 *
 * The equation for this function is given by:
 *
 * f(x) = -0.1 * {\sum_{i=0}^{n}{cos(5 * pi * {x_i})}}-\sum_{i=0}^{n}{x_i}^{2}
 *
 * Cosine Mixture function have a global minima in {0,..., 0} with a value of 
 * 0.2 or 0.4 for n=2 and 4 respectively.
 * A commonly used search domain for testing is [-1, 1]. Cosine Mixture 
 * is discontinuous, non-differentiable, separable, scalable and multimodal. 
 * See the following reference [f_38] in:
